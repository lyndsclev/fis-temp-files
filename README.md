# Friendless in Seattle Front-End 

## Description
Pandemic life has meant a lot of changes for many, including moving to a new town or city.

Between lockdowns, working remotely, and masks, how do you organically make new friends in your new environment? Well, you don’t. You’re Friendless in Seattle. 

Our app helps you connect locally or remotely with people that share your interests so that you can make a new friend… or seven! 

This README is to show a lot of the front-end work that I did for this group project. The official repo can be found here https://github.com/Clos01/Friendless-in-seattle. 

The deployed application can be found here https://friendless-in-seattle.herokuapp.com/.

## Technologies 
The work that I put into this group project focused primarily on: 

* HTML 
* CSS
* Bulma
* Handlebars 
* JavaScript 

## Logo
For this project, I created a logo that is an upside down F to signify the "less" part of friendless. It was created in the font used for the Sleepless in Seattle movie poster, Bodoni. 

I leveraged it as the favicon for the deployed app.

## Wireframe
Prior to our team diving in, I wireframed the look of our app. Here is a snapshot:

## Deployed
You can find the deployed app on heroku here https://friendless-in-seattle.herokuapp.com/. 

I was able to take the wireframe concepts and apply them to the app fairly closely, making changes as we ran into obstacles/changes during the short, two-week period alloted to build the app.

Without the help of my teammates, getting this project off the ground, functioning, and deployed would have been impossible.
